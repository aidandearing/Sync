I need to decide if their is going to be any modularity to the characters skills. 
I can't see it working, I built every character around their passive, which means you can't really switch skills, only complete versions.
I think I am just going to build each character version as a specific 'class' you pick to use, this will make the code that much easier to do.
Time to throw out the 'SkillManager' given each character is going to have a very unique 'Behaviour' script.

I also need to build an 'effect' system, I think.
It definitely makes handling effects easier.

Harmonics
	Tempo
		The speed of a piece of music.
			Momentum
				Each kill increases movement speed for a short duration
			Burst
				Short boost of speed
			Boost
				Jump twice as high, and grant increased movement control until landed
			Slow
				Create a sphere of slowed time, all teammates move normally but all projectiles and enemies are slowed drastically
			Rewind
				Tempo steps back to its location 2 seconds earlier
			Pause Grenade
				On impact freezes any enemies and their projectiles caught in the blast radius for a short time
			
			VERSION 2----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Inertia
				Projectiles around Tempo are slowed the slower Tempo is moving, nearly pausing if Tempo isn't moving, but move faster if Tempo is moving quickly
			Reverse
				Projectiles near Tempo have their velocity flipped, traveling back the way they came
			Stop
				Tempo creates a wall that prevents projectiles from moving through it for some time
			Blink
				Tempo instantly travels forward several metres, disabling Inertia for several seconds
			Pause

					CEG || CGE || ECG || EGC || GCE || GEC
						Knocks all enemies away and buffs teammate movement speed
					ACE || AEC || CAE || CEA || EAC || ECA
						Releases a chaotic nova of wandering homing projectiles, enemies are hurt, teammates are healed
					ACG || AGC || CAG || CGA || GAC || GCA
						Creates a series of shield panels that slowly rotate around a central point, each can take several hits
					AEG || AGE || EAG || EGA || GAE || GEA
						Creates a field that slows enemies and increases teammate regeneration
			C
				When Chords triggers a C will be part of the Chord
			E
				When Chords triggers an E will be part of the Chord
			G
				When Chords triggers a G will be part of the Chord
			A
				When Chords triggers an A will be part of the Chord
			Music Box
